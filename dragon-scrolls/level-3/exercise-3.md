### Step 3: Get Information on a Specific Business 
* Refer to the online [API documentation](http://api.searchcompany.us) to see 
how to use the results of the search to get the information you need to get 
more information on a specific business.

* Pull out the necessary information from the JSON body/payload of the search
request.  Talk about what is happening here with the class.

    ```python
    if __name__ == "__main__":
        search_url = "{}/{}".format("http://api.searchcompany.us/1.0/search", "Panda")
        results = requests.get(search_url)
        
        company_ids = []   # Alternatively, company_ids = list()
        for company_record in results.json()['company']:
            company_ids.append(company_record['id'])
    ```

* **Advanced Tidbit**: Pythonistas use a feature call _list comprehensions_ to 
dynamically generate lists like the one we've made without the need to
define the list ahead of time and construct a loop.  Here's how that would look:

    ```python
    if __name__ == "__main__":
        search_url = "{}/{}".format("http://api.searchcompany.us/1.0/search", "Panda")
        results = requests.get(search_url)
        
        # List Comprehension (Cool points in Python bars)
        company_ids = [company_record['id'] for company_record in results.json()['company']]
    ```

* Make additional calls to the API to retrieve detailed information on each 
business ID that you've obtained.

    ```python
    if __name__ == "__main__":
        search_url = "{}/{}".format("http://api.searchcompany.us/1.0/search", "Panda")
        results = requests.get(search_url)
        
        company_ids = []   # Alternatively, company_ids = list()
        for company_record in results.json()['company']:
            company_ids.append(company_record['id'])
            
        company_info = [] 
        for company_id in company_ids:
            lookup_url = "{}/{}".format("http://api.searchcompany.us/1.0/company", company_id)
            lookup_results = requests.get(lookup_url)
            company_info.append(lookup_results.json())
            
        print(company_info)
    ```
    
* What would this look like using a list comprehension? What about the Zen of Python?

    ```python
    if __name__ == "__main__":
        search_url = "{}/{}".format("http://api.searchcompany.us/1.0/search", "Panda")
        results = requests.get(search_url)
    
        company_ids = []   # Alternatively, company_ids = list()
        for company_record in results.json()['company']:
            company_ids.append(company_record['id'])
    
        company_info = [
            requests.get("{}/{}".format(
                "http://api.searchcompany.us/1.0/company", company_id)).json()
            for company_id in company_ids]
    
        print(company_info)
    ```
