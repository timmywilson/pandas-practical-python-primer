## Training Topics

### Overview of Modern Web Services/APIs
* What are web services/web APIs?
* The currently dominate form of web services: RESTful.
    * Uses HTTP(s) protocol with standard methods: GET/POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE
    * Messages consist of headers and a body/payload.
    * In most cases, modern APIs message bodies are in [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON).
    ```
    Example HTTP Response from a RESTful Web Api
    
    * Hostname was NOT found in DNS cache
    *   Trying 198.41.141.12...
    * Connected to api.searchcompany.us (198.41.141.12) port 80 (#0)
    > GET /1.0/search/indiana HTTP/1.1
    > User-Agent: curl/7.37.1
    > Host: api.searchcompany.us
    > Accept: */*
    >

### Interacting with Web Services in Python
* There is a package in the standard library, `urllib2`, which can be used to 
  interact with web services.  However, it is not very easy to use... :(
* But, a friendly Pythonista named Kenneth Reitz came along and provided an 
awesome package called [`requests`](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/) that really simplifies working with web
apis.  This is one of the reasons Python is awesome, because there are 
so many people out there creating awesome stuff and sharing it for free.
