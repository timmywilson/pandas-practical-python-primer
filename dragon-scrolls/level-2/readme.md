# Level Two: Command Line Interfaces
A CLI, or **command line interface**, is a program that exposes 
its functionality via the command-line.  I know, what a shock.

We've already been using a very sophisticated CLI - Vagrant.  In this level 
of our training, you'll be learning to create your very own CLIs.  We are going
to do it twice.  The first time using the `argparse` module of the standard
library and then with the `click` third party library.

## Training Setup
- [Grab the latest class updates](../level-0/git-merging-upstream-changes.md) 
**and** push them into your remote repository.
- Submit pull requests with you latest homework assignment.
- [Setup a new project in PyCharm](../level-0/pycharm-project-setup.md).

## Overview of Training Topics
- Definition and examples of CLIs
- Creating a CLI with the Python Standard Library
- Creating a CLI with the Click 3rd party library
- Introduction to the `import` system
- The meaning and purpose of `if __name__ == "__main__"

## Homework Assignments
The following are possible homework assignments for this level - **not to 
mention the ones that I'll make up on the fly**:
- PEP 257: Docstring Conventions
