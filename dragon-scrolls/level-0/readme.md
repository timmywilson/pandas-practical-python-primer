# Welcome to Level Zero

### The Way of the Dragon Warrior (Class Philosophy)  
Thank you so much for being a part of this class.  Python is an amazing language
that is used just about everywhere and can do just about anything.  At the same
time it is very beginner friendly and has a huge open-source community around 
it.  You've made a great choice to learn it.

Now, we'll all know this proverb of physical fitness: **no pain, no gain**.  The 
same thing can be said about learning a new programming language.  It takes work!
  
But also just like in physical health, hard work at coding can have great 
rewards.  By the end of this course, my hope is that you'll have the necessary
foundation to keep improving your skills and be on your way to becoming
a true Python Dragon Warrior. 

### The Way of Big Fat Panda (Class Rules)  
**This is my grumpy section - it won't last too long.** 
Like any coach, I've got some rules. I ask you to follow them as I believe 
that they will help you and your classmates to learn:

1. **Don't miss class.**  We're going to cover **a lot** of material in a short 
time frame and it will be difficult to catch up.  If you aren't committed to 
being here, then please give your spot to someone who is.
    * Now, if you're sick, your kiddo is sick, or your house floods - I'll 
    understand and I'll meet with you outside of class to get your caught up.
    
2. **Don't work on other stuff during class.**  Multitasking is a myth.  You'll 
either be learning the material or doing something else.  We'll take regular 
breaks so you can check your email, etc.

3. **Ask Questions!**  I know it's hard to ask questions.  I've been there, 
not really understanding something but not wanting to look dumb. Take heart, 
I guarantee that every single person in the class will not understand or be 
plain wrong about something during the course, **including me** - because I 
actually am dumb ;)
    * To help break people out of this fear, I will make a really big deal of 
    my own type-o's and mistakes so hopefully your's will feel like the minor
    thing they really are.
    * I will also directly ask people questions in class.  **This might feel 
    awkward at first, both for me and you**, but I think it will help us 
    establish at atmosphere where asking questions is easier.
