# Vagrant
[Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com) is a tool that creates uniform development 
environments (virtual machines) that can be shared amongst team members.  
In other words, it is a way of getting an identical development setup on all 
computers, regardless of the underlying OS (Windows/Mac).

We will be using it to create a uniform environment to learn Python in our
class. This allows us to focus on Python rather than various environment
differences.

## Prereqs
* Download and install [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html).
* Download and install [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads). 

    > ![Information](../images/information.png)  Vagrant can also work with
    other VM providers like VMWare. For class however, we'll be Virtualbox
    because it is **free**. Cha-Ching!
    
## Microsoft Warning
I've seen problems using Vagrant on, ahem, older PCs.  So, if you've got
an older PC, you should plan on spending a little extra time here. I've never 
seen one that couldn't be fixed with some TLC, but just an FYI.

## How It Works
Vagrant uses a special file, rather boringly called `Vagrantfile` to create
development VMs.  Teams write and then share Vagrantfile(s) with each other
so that all team members can have an identical environment to work from.

We'll be doing the same thing here.
    
## Training Steps
1. Take a look at `Vagrantfile` at the root directory of the class folder.
    - It's written in Ruby (lame) but not too hard to understand.
    - The `config.vm.box` variable specifies the "base image" that we'll be 
    using.  A base image is just a bare OS without anything added to it.  We'll
    get to the adding stuff in a bit.
        - I'm lying a bit here in this description to keep things simple. Ask
        me if you want a more nuanced explanation.
    - The `config.vm.network` entry allows us to map a virtual port to an 
    actual port on your host system.  We'll use this later in the course
    when we are building websites.
    - The 3 entries of `config.vm.provision` reference files in the `system-setup`
    directory that will be run after the system is booted that install 
    all the necessary dependencies for us to do our work.
    
    > ![Homework](../images/reminder.png) Check out the files in the 
    `system-setup` directory.  They are all shell scripts that Vagrant 
    runs to provision(setup) the machine.  Can you figure out what they
    are doing?

2. Create your virtual machine by running `vagrant up`.
    - This operation will take a significant amount of time the first time 
    you run it because the system has to download the OS image.  The 
    time that this takes will be largely dependent on your network speed.
    
3. Log in to the machine by executing this command: `vagrant ssh`.  If this
doesn't work, the system failed to build.  **Wah wah.**  We'll have to work
together on this because your system is probably "special".
    - You should get a new prompt that looks like this: `vagrant@vagrant-ubuntu-trusty-64:~$`

4. Run the following tests to make sure everything is working correctly:
    - `pyenv`: Should display something.
    - `dragon-warrior`: Should take you to `/vagrant/training` directory.
    - `git`: Should display something.
    
5. Ok - Sweet.  Things are looking good. Now let's see how to turn our machine
off and on.  Go ahead and exit your SSH terminal session by typing `exit`

6. You should be deposited back in your class folder on your hard drive.  From
here you can do one of two things:
    - `vagrant suspend`: Saves the RAM contents of the machine and suspends it.
    Using this option eats up more hard disk space, but is faster when you
    want to restart the the VM.
    - `vagrant halt`: Issues an actual shutdown command to the VM.  It takes
    longer - both to shutdown and restart - but uses less hard drive space.
    - In practice, both are functionally equivalent. You should just use 
    whichever one you can remember more easily in most cases.

    > If you shut down your system without doing so, you'll likely mess up 
    > the internal state of the VM and have to rebuild it.  It's easy to do,
    > but takes some time.
    
7. Restart the VM using `vagrant up` and ssh back into it to complete the cycle.
    
5. Nice! Now you're ready to Rock n' Roll.  Take a look at the

memory on the basic commands.
