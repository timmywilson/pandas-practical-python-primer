# System Setup
Before we begin, we'll need to get some software onto our machines so that
we can access the class materials, write Python, and test our code.

## Install Git / Creating a GitHub Account
The first thing we need to do is get access to the class materials.  To do this
we'll need to install a program called Git on our computers and create a 
Github account.

Git is, by far, the most popular version control / source control program in
the world today.  Developers use version control systems to efficiently track
changes to project files that occur over time (or retrieve them in case of 
a system crash) **and** provide a mechanism to effectively work with others on 
the same project.

The class materials are stored in a Git repository that is available online
at Github.  We'll need Git on our systems and a Github account to download the
class materials (and updates to them throughout our course).

If you haven't used Git before - great!  This will be a great introduction and
we'll take it slow.

### Training Steps
1. Download and install the [latest version of Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
This will allow you to run Git on your local machine and interact with the
repositories in Github.

2. [Create an account](https://github.com/join) if you don't already have one 
at Github.  The basic account is free and that's all you'll be needing.


## Fork the Class Repo & Clone it to your System
If you're new to Git, you probably just said **WAT!?**  Not a problem.  One
step at a time.

In the world of Github (and services like it) if you want to make a personal
copy of somebody else's project you **fork** it.  This creates a copy of a
project under your account which you can then mess to your hearts content 
but the original isn't affected.  When you fork a project, Github also remembers 
the original repo so that you can "pull" down updates from it.

After you fork the class repo, you'll need to get a copy of it on your local 
machine.  This operation is called "cloning".

Alright?  Let's get started.

### Training Steps

**Fork the Class Repo**

1. Visit the class repo at [https://github.com/bigfatpanda-training/pandas-practical-python-primer](https://github.com/bigfatpanda-training/pandas-practical-python-primer)
2. Click the ![github-fork.png](../images/github-fork.png) button to fork 
(make a copy of) the project in your own Github account.  
3. You should be taken to your copy of the class repo when the process 
completes. **Congratulations!**  The first step is done.  You should see
something like this (but it will have your username instead of eikonomega).

    ![forked repo](../images/github-forked-repo.png)

**Clone the Repo to your Machine**

1. On your Github repo page (the one you just got to in the previous step), 
you should see something that looks like this:

    ![clone-repo-url](../images/github-clone-repo.png)
    
    > ![alert.png](../images/alert.png) Make sure that the you've chosen the 
    `HTTPS` link and then copy the URL in the dialogue box to your clipboard.  

3. Open a terminal window.  Windows users should use the 'Git Bash' program
that was installed on your system by the Git installer.  It approximates a
linux terminal.  For Mac users, I highly recommend iTerm2.  Alternatively,
Mac users can also use the built-in Terminal program.

4. Pick a location where you want to clone your fork of the class repo.  
    > ![information](../images/information.png) If you are fairly new to using 
    > a terminal, I suggest that you put it in the directory that the terminal 
    > window places you in on Mac/Linux machines or at the root `C:` directory
    > on Windows.
    > 
    > This will make it easier to remember when you put things in later classes.  
    > Either way, make sure you **write down when you decided to clone the repo.**
 
5. Execute the following command to clone the repo: 
`git clone [paste the url you picked up in step 2 here]`
    - Git will ask you for your Github username/password and then spit out a
whole bunch of information at you. If you entered your information correctly 
it will download all the class files.  Here's what it should look like:

        ```bash
        Cloning into 'pandas-practical-python-primer'...
        remote: Counting objects: 752, done.
        remote: Compressing objects: 100% (17/17), done.
        remote: Total 752 (delta 8), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 735
        Receiving objects: 100% (752/752), 1.06 MiB | 1.63 MiB/s, done.
        Resolving deltas: 100% (333/333), done.
        Checking connectivity... done.
        ```

    - Verify that this worked by trying to enter the repo folder and listing the contents:
        - `cd pandas-practical-python-primer`
        - `ls -la`
        
**Well Done!** You've made it to the end of this section.  Go eat a cookie!

## Installing PyCharm
Using an IDE **can** be very helpful. Particularly for beginners, they
can be immensely time saving - primarily because of the code completion
that they offer.

I strongly suggest that you use the most popular Python IDE, [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/).
That's the tool that I'll be using in class and it's got some great features
that will really help you as your are getting started with Python.

There are multiple editions of the tool offered.  For our class, I suggest
that you download a trial of the professional edition if you didn't receive
a key already.  The open-source version is quite versatile, but it does lack
support for remote interpreters, which we will be using. Don't worry about 
what a remote interpreter is ;)

## Using a Virtual Machine
In the vast majority of circumstances, the Python code that you write will
eventually run on some flavor of Linux.

Because of this (and because debugging Windows issues is enough to drive you
mad) we'll all be using an Ubuntu virtual machine to run the code that you
create and the class examples.

You have a few different choices for how you want to approach this:

1. Use Vagrant to create a local VM.
2. Create a Ubuntu VM in AWS using a personal account.
3. Utilize nitrous.io to create an VM that is accessible via their console.

Each of these methods has positives / negatives and all of them will take a
little bit of time to get setup.
  
The most complex is the using AWS, and if you want to go that route, you'll
probably need a significant amount of previous experience to know how to 
create the instance, connect to it, etc.

Here are some links to further specific instructions for these methods:
