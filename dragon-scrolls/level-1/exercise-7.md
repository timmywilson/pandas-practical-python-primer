## Exercise 7: Set Types: Sets and Frozensets
- Non-ordered containers that hold heterogeneous unique members.
- Very fast membership testing.  Slower for iteration than lists.
- Have the intersection, union, difference, and symmetric difference methods.
- All members are immutable.  In FrozenSets, the set itself is
immutable as well.
